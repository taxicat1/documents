# Documents
In this repository, I will collect documents, writings, papers and publications that I write for various reasons. Some of these documents will be assignments from my Master's study that turn out interesting enough that others might want to see them. Other documents will be produced for work reasons or out of personal interest.

## [Finding Software Vulnerabilities](finding-software-vulnerabilities/Finding%20Software%20Vulnerabilities.md)
At the time of writing this paper, I knew very little about how one would go about finding a software vulnerability, and potentially exploit it, so when I got the chance, I did some research into existing publications on the subject, and summarized everything in this paper.

## [Mobile Application Sandboxing](mobile-application-sandboxing/Mobile%20Application%20Sandboxing.md)
This paper explores the technology used to protect users of mobile phones against malicious application by sandboxing them.

## [Web Payments Value Chains](web-payments-value-chains/Web%20Payments%20Value%20Chains.md)
I have spent quite some time working with the [Web Payments](https://www.w3.org/Payments/) specifications, and have had numerous discussions with various people on what the best strategy for adoption would be, and whether the technology is even viable. This document expresses the various forms of web payments as value chains, which provides an interesting and illuminating perspective on the subject.
