# Finding Software Vulnerabilities
## Abstract
As mobile devices replace old-fashioned computers for more and more of our daily tasks, they become very attractive targets for criminals. Despite efforts to detect and block malicious applications from entering the app stores, all the major stores contain significant amounts of malicious apps. It is up to the security mechanisms implemented in the mobile platforms to keep the users safe from fraud and identity theft. One common security mechanism that can be found in all the major mobile platforms, is *application sandboxing*.

In this paper, we will take a closer look at how application sandboxing works in the two largest platforms, Android and iOS. We will see examples of how malicious apps can break out of the sandbox, and we will have a look at various proposals for improving the sandboxes.
